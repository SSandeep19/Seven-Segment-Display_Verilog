# Seven-Segment-Display_Verilog
A module in Verilog to control Seven-Segment display. This module is designed and implemented for Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.
The seven-segment display used in a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA is a common anode diaplay with 8 digit display.
The common anode signals are avalable as eight pins. For Nexys A7 board the anode should be diven low to light up a particular seven-segment and for a particular segment to light up the cathode must
